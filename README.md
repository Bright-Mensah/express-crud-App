<h3>This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks or to-do items. The front-end of the application is built using React, which allows for a fast and responsive user interface. The back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provides a flexible and scalable server-side framework. MongoDB is used as the database to store task data. Users can create new tasks, edit or delete tasks, and view all tasks in a list. </h3>
